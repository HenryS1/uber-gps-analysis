This will be a collection of analyses for the GPS drive data released by uber.
Right now we just read the data from the file and store it in an internal format.

Input data (gpsdata/all.tsv) taken from from http://www.infochimps.com/datasets/uber-anonymized-gps-logs
For details about input data, see gpsdata/README.txt
